 * \brief UniformPackInfo encapsulates information on how to extract data from blocks,
 * that should be communicated (see packData() ) to neighboring blocks
 * and how to inject this data in a receiving block (see unpackData() )
 *
 * Another special method exists for communication between two blocks,
 * which are allocated on the same
 * process. In this case the data does not have be communicated via a buffer,
 * but can be copied directly.
 *
 * Data that is packed in direction "dir" at one block is unpacked in
 * direction "stencil::inverseDir[dir]" at the neighboring block. This
 * behavior must be implemented in "communicateLocal"!
